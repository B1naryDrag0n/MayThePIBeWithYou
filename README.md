# May The PI Be With You

I bought a Raspberry PI 3B a little while back. I messed with it a bit before
putting it aside for a good year. Recently, I stumbled on a nice kit while
surfing: a bunch of electronic and electrical components to play with the PI
along with tutorials on how to make a lot of little projects.

I decided this would be a good opportunity to learn python, and just thought,
"Why not put this all on GitHub?!"

So here it is! My first GitHub repo! *cheers*

My journey to master the PI and learn python! W00t! \o/

Hype is real! c:
