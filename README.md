# May The PI Be With You

I bought a Raspberry PI 3B a little while back. I messed with it a bit before
putting it aside for a good year. Recently, I stumbled on a nice kit while
surfing: a bunch of electronic and electrical components to use with the PI
along with tutorials on how to make a lot of little projects with all this 
stuff.

I decided this would be a good opportunity to learn python, and just thought,
"Why not put this all on GitHub?!"

So here it is! My first GitHub repo! *cheers*

My journey to master the PI and learn python! W00t! \o/

Hype is real! c:

## Projects

![Fun Kit!](/Images/001_funKit.jpg)

I am basically following the projects in this Freenove kit. From the very first
and all the way to the last! By doing so, I hope to put my Raspberry PI to better
use than just gathering dust and also learn python along the way, so of course I
will be messing with the python version of each project, aiming to customize them
all by adding my own little features.

So let's open the fun kit and get coding!

### LEDMadness

First project is a blinking LED. So had to at least allow the user to turn the LED
on and off, and it has four blinking controls, to make the LED flash at four
different speeds.

Added a very basic console UI so the user knows how to control the LED.
